I think it's time to test out new Oakwood MP build, now featuring:
- server browser
- onfoot sync
- chat (open by pressing 'T')
- more crashes
- chat with UTF-8 support (yes, we can do cyrillic or ščýšč [Latin Extended-A])

Known Issues:
- loader.exe might fail to start the game on several attempts, just keep re-starting it
- inventory might be de-synchronised due to known bug
- chat doesn't wrap text around
- some writing systems are not included (Japanese, Chinese)

Supported Versions:
- Boxed 1.2 game
- GOG
- Steam (still to be fully verified)

NOTE: Russian version of the game is not supported due to file differences, this might be temporal issue.

Chat commands:
/q - quits the game
/utf - prints random unicode string
